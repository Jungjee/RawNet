# Overview
This repository includes implementations of speaker verification systems that input raw waveforms.

Currently, it includes four systems in [python](python/). 
Detailed instructions on each system is described in individual `ReadME` files.
## RawNet3
- PyTorch implementation
- Performance
  - supervised learning with AAM-Softmax: EER 0.89%
  - self-supervised learning: EER 5.40%
- Training recipe
  - Will be served in https://github.com/clovaai/voxceleb_trainer 
- Inference
  - Pre-trained weight parameters are stored in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/jungjee/RawNet3) and is included as a submodule.
  - Vox1-O benchmark is available in [RawNet3](python/RawNet3).
  - Extracting speaker embedding from any 16k 16bit mono utterance is supported.
- Published as a conference paper in Interspeech 2022.

## RawNet2_modified
- Code refactoring
  - PyTorch ResNet alike model implementation
  - Deeper architecture
  - Improved feature map scaling method
    - [Î±-feature map scaling for raw waveform speaker verification]( https://doi.org/10.7776/ASK.2020.39.5.441 )
      - Only abstract is in English
  - Angular loss function adopted
- Performance
  - EER 1.91%
    - Trained using VoxCeleb2
    - VoxCeleb1 original trial
  - Will be used as a baseline system for authors' future works
## RawNet2

- Improved performance than RawNet
  - DNN speaker embedding extraction with raw waveform inputs
  - cosine similarity back-end
  - EER 4.8% -->> 2.56%
    - VoxCeleb1 original trial
- Uses a technique named feature map scaling
  - scales feature map alike squeeze-excitation
- Implemented in PyTorch.
- Published as a conference paper in Interspeech 2020.

## RawNet
- DNN-based speaker embedding extractor used with another DNN-based classifier
  - Built on top of authors' previous works on raw waveform speaker verification
    - [ICASSP2018](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8462575) and [Interspeech2018](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2018/pdfs/1608.pdf)
  - EER 4.8% with cosine simaility back-end, 4.0% with proposed concat&mul back-end
    - VoxCeleb1 original trial
- Implemented in Keras and PyTorch
- Published as a conference paper in Interspeech 2019.
