# Notice
This repository is under update to reflect codes for reproducing our recent paper. 
For reproduction of the original RawNet paper, please refer to `RawNet1' folder

# Overview

This github project includes PyTorch implementation for reproducing experiments and DNN models used in the paper
[Improved RawNet with Filter-wise Re-scaling for\\ Text-independent Speaker Verification using Raw Waveforms]( https://isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2019/pdfs/1982.pdf ) 
which is submitted to Interspeech2020 as a conference paper.

	

#  Using pre-trained model
